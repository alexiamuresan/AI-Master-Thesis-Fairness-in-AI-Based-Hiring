This repository contains:
- 6 file with the inal versions of code used in the bias evaluations. Note: this is the code only for scenario 2 (train of biased data, test on balanced data). The rest of the results     can be reproduced by simply changing the datsets used in the notebooks.
- 3 synthetically generated datasets: 1 balanced, 1 gender biased, 1 biased in terms of ethnicity.
- Code used to compute the number of trainable parameters in the instances of traditional models used in this thesis. The number of parameters for the LLMs is considered common    
  knowledge/found online, not directly computed.
- Code used to generate the synthetic datasets.
